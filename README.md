# Advent of Code 2019

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This is my attempt to solve each puzzle in a different programming language! 😬

## Build and run with Docker

For example for day 1:
